A take on the idea of Microsoft Recall with the purpose of generating reports of user activity.

With its default configuration, it captures a screenshot of all displays every 5 minutes. Every 2 hours, all unprocessed screenshots are sent to the user's preferred vision model to process them and describe the user's activity.

A report can be generated by the user at any time by selecting screenshots through the user interface and clicking the 'Report' button. A report will be generated with screenshots from today, which will be accessible from the 'Reports' page.
