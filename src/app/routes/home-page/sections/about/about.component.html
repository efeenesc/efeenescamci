		<p>
			I develop websites, desktop programs, mobile apps; increase organizational
			security, automate business-critical workflows, manage cloud
			infrastructure; experiment with ideas, take on new challenges, reinvent
			the wheel, and have fun.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-2">
			I started programming in 2021 with the intent to create fun websites to
			share with friends. It quickly replaced all my other hobbies. I then
			naturally gravitated towards the backend over time in order to create
			websites that serve dynamic content.

		<p class="mt-2">
			I have 3 years of professional experience where I worked with a plethora
			of different technologies and informally wore many hats:
